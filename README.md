### üåè Translations

You can submit your translations to us. We really appreciate that!

We will review the quality of the translated text and then add it to our repository. \
Before doing translation, please familiarize yourself with our resource format:

#### Resource path

We will locate the resource files based on the location of file relative to the plugin's data directory.

Refer to [Bukkit module lang](https://github.com/Rothes/ESU/tree/master/bukkit/src/main/resources/lang/modules)
to understand the resource file storage format.

Besides, please ensure that the translation resources you are adding is located under the correct subproject.
For example, if you are adding translation for velocity modules, then go velocity subproject.

#### Lang folder translations

If you want to add a language resource to the lang directory, simply copy the en_us.yml file and modify it.

#### Config file translations

We support comment translations for config files.
We have a unique mechanism for this, so please make sure you understand the following rules:

- Only comments modified entries are kept.
- The value of entry should be set to `~`.

Refer to [Plugin config lang](https://github.com/Rothes/ESU/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/lang/config.yml/zh_cn.yml) for a practical demonstration.
